# Project Context

## Purpose
Personal finance management application for budget tracking, expense management, and savings goals. Built for individual use initially, with architecture designed to scale into a full application.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Database:** Azure SQL (cloud-hosted)
- **API Style:** RESTful with OpenAPI documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8, use `black` for formatting, `ruff` or `flake8` for linting
- **TypeScript/React:** Use ESLint + Prettier, functional components with hooks
- **Naming:** snake_case for Python, camelCase for TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Type hints:** Required for all Python functions, strict TypeScript mode enabled

### Architecture Patterns
- **Backend:** Repository pattern for data access, service layer for business logic
- **Frontend:** Component-based architecture, custom hooks for shared logic
- **API:** RESTful endpoints, consistent error responses, versioned API paths

### Testing Strategy
- **Approach:** Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Python:** pytest with high coverage requirements (>80%)
- **React:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration:** API endpoint tests with test database
- **Requirement:** Tests must pass before merging any PR

### Git Workflow
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits format
  - `feat:` new features
  - `fix:` bug fixes
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `test:` test additions/changes
  - `refactor:` code refactoring
  - `chore:` maintenance tasks
- **Branches:** Feature branches merged to main via PR
- **Reviews:** Code review required before merge

## Domain Context
- **Transactions:** Income and expenses with categories, dates, and amounts
- **Budgets:** Monthly spending limits per category
- **Accounts:** Bank accounts, credit cards, cash tracking
- **Goals:** Savings targets with progress tracking
- **Currency:** Single currency support initially (expandable)

## Important Constraints
- Personal use initially, but architecture should support multi-user
- Financial data requires accurate decimal handling (avoid floating point)
- Azure SQL connection requires secure credential management
- No PII sharing with third-party services

## External Dependencies
- **Azure SQL Database:** Primary data store (cloud-hosted)
- **Azure services:** Potential future integrations (Auth, Storage)
